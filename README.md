# (AiC03) Azure Database migration

Project prompt:

> In this project, you will architect and implement a cloud-based database system on Microsoft Azure, showcasing your hands-on expertise in cloud engineering.
>
> You'll begin by establishing a production environment database. Subsequently, you'll migrate the database to Azure SQL Database, focusing on crucial aspects like data backup, restoration, and automated scheduling. These efforts will strengthen your data management approach.
>
> A pivotal phase of the project involves simulating a disaster recovery scenario with potential data loss. Furthermore, you will explore the complexities of geo-replication and failover configuration to ensure data availability even uder challenging conditions.
>
> To enhance security, Microsoft Entra ID integration will be employed to define access roles, adding an extra layer of control and protection

## Comments

- The initial project setup was very simple and smooth. I definitely spent more efforts into personlizing the brand-new VM. As for SQL server and SSMS, the installation process took longer than expected.
- The production database restoration ran into a problem: I was unable to select the destination folder inside my user's Desktop. Workaround: placing the project folder directly on `C:\` folder.
